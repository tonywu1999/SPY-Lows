# SPY ETF Analyzer

To start off this project, I checked into how low the SPY can drop from
a specific day after a chosen number of business days.  I call this the 
SPY's maximum drop.  This is important because even in a bull market, it's 
important to understand what's considered a huge drop versus a mild drop over 
a period of time.  When is it a good trading period vs a bad one?
